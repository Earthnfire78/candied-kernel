It's used internally to help with page regeneration.","body":"# Hello and welcome\r\n\r\n## Some information's about this kernel project\r\nThis kernel is created for the LGE p500 by using the official cyanogen kernel for LGE msm7x27(T) as base.\r\nSince I started my work there are lots of modifications implemented, for example:\r\n* kernel source is updated (2.6.35.10 -> 2.6.35.13 -> 2.6.35.14)\r\n* back ported driver from later kernel sources (2.6.36 and 3.0)\r\n* improved battery life\r\n* changes to improve stability and performance\r\n* cifs, tun, advanced routing, fuse are compiled into kernel\r\n\r\n## Warning\r\nI'm not responsible if you brick your device by heavy OC, flashing ...\r\nUsing using very high frequencies (> 729Mhz) is dangerous and can melt your phone main board!\r\n\r\n## Before flashing this kernel\r\nKernel source based on 2.6.35 are for use with gingerbread (2.3) and ics/jellybean (use special **ics** version).\r\nThis means older android versions (2.2 and older) are not compatible.\r\nIf you have problems with other roms than cyanogen (or cyanogen based), this kernel is maybe not 100% compatible with your rom.\r\n\r\n## Downloads\r\n- [xda-developers](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=24560941&postcount=1) (only latest / selected)\r\n- [github](http://github.com/DJNoXD/candied-kernel-releases) (only latest / testing)\r\n- [googledrive](https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B8b2O5uDZNrbMkRFR0hiNno2NzA) (all)\r\n\r\n# FAQs:\r\n## Which kernel version should I choose?\r\n### vsyncOff\r\nIf you always want the highest possible frame rate, you should take this one.\r\n(Disadvantage tearing)\r\n\r\n### vsync\r\nNo tearing, constant frame rate (60fps)\r\nIf the frame rate (60fps) isn't possible, the fps is divided by two (30fps -> 15fps and so on)\r\n\r\n### caveman or default touchscreen driver\r\nYou have to try which one you like.\r\nIf you don't want to try take the default version.\r\n\r\n## When will you release a new version?\r\nNew versions are released if changes are implemented, tested and if I think they are good enough to be released.\r\nSuccessful implemented changes of an unreleased version can be found an in the changelog.\r\n\r\n## Will this kernel work with rom xyz?\r\nThis kernel is based on cyanogen kernel. If the ROM you use is cyanogen 7 or based on it there should be no problems.\r\nI guess it should work with every gb rom, but there is no guarantee.\r\n\r\nIf you use a gingerbread ROM which is not based on cyanogen, feel free to test yourself (Create a backup, flash kernel and test it) and share your result with us. \r\n\r\n## How do I install the kernel?\r\n* Reboot to Recovery\r\n* Choose: install zip from sdcard -> choose zip from sdcard\r\n* Select the kernel zip file\r\n* wipe cache and dalvik cache (not a must but I recommend)\r\n* Reboot (if kernel is successful installed)\r\n\r\n## Why is advanced routing included?\r\nSome VPN apps need advanced routing features to work completely.\r\n\r\n## Could you include ...?\r\nTell me what you like to see and if possible the sources.\r\nI will take a look at and decide if it can be included. (and if I want to)\r\n\r\n## I found an error. / I have a problem. What can I do?\r\nPost your problem at [xda-developers](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1587209).\r\nIf you are using my kernels on other ROMs than cyanogen or with older android versions, please keep in mind that your ROM is maybe incompatible with this kernel.\r\n\r\n## Example battery usage of my phone\r\nThe hard drops happen while using date (mostly with wlan) or running some benchmark.\r\n![battery consumption](http://img.tapatalk.com/02ce0008-c977-1fc7.jpg)\r\n\r\n#explanation of the abbreviations\r\n* vsync = vsync enabled\r\n* vsyncOff = vsync disabled\r\n*
